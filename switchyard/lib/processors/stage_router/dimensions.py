"""Scorer-ready view of :class:`ToolResultSignal` — two axes, five signals.

The stage_router scorer models a coding turn on two axes:

* **error** — did the recent tool results error?  ``severity`` (escalate-only; a
  clean-result streak used to sit on this axis but cancelled the windowed error
  signal and released escalations too early, so it was removed).
* **production** — is the agent producing code?  ``spinning`` / ``exploring``
  (bad poles) vs ``recent_production_intensity`` (good pole).

``spinning`` and ``exploring`` are mutually exclusive, split by whether the
agent is doing *any* investigative work (reads / plans) in the recent window:
``spinning`` = not even looking, ``exploring`` = looking but not building.

Every field here is consumed — ``severity`` by the picker override, the rest by
the scorer weights. All counts are over the recent window; see the notes on
:func:`from_signal` for the two windowing caveats.

    Windowing notes (both inherent to routing on the normalised request):

    * ``turn_depth`` is a raw *message* count, so its scale varies by wire format
      (Anthropic batches tool results into fewer messages than OpenAI-chat). The
      ``_STALL_MIN_TURN_DEPTH`` gate is therefore approximate across origins.
    * ``severity`` is windowed over the last N tool *results* while the ``recent_*``
      counts are over the last N tool *calls* — usually the same turns, but a
      trailing call without a result yet can offset them by one.
